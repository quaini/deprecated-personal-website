            As a co-op on the DevOps Tools Automation Team, I refactored, maintained, and wrote object-oriented applications in Groovy which generated build and deploy jobs on Jenkins instances to facilitate CI/CD. I coordinated with 10+ development teams to ensure requirements were properly implemented and repeatable tasks were automated in an Agile work environment. While coordinating with other teams to fulfill various requests such as automating API test calls or creating new build and deploy jobs, I continued to field Jira tickets for my own team.

            During my first summer after college, I worked for a placement firm in the mornings building web-based campaigns and designing landing pages within HubSpot portal for recruits. I used each recruit's questionnaire and resume to translate their experience and interests into targeted campaigns to increase their placement potential.
