I am hesitant to make promises about what this blog will be because frankly, I'm not sure.

A few months ago, I told my neighbor of my ambitions to become a programmer, and he recommended that I start my own tech blog. Having had success in the tech field himself, I am happily taking his advice; however, I'm not sure that I am willing to dedicate the entirety of "my blog" to just tech. As much as I am infatuated with this ever-expanding subject, I feel it would be an inaccurate portrayal of myself to only write about one of my interests. Perhaps, mixing business with pleasure here is unwise, but I'd rather paint a more holistic picture.

I envision this blog serving as my very own archive in a way. I think that consistently uploading posts here will not only facilitate my tech career, but also, accurately capture my thoughts, attitudes, interests, and goals over the years. I believe that maintaining this blog will serve as a useful exercise in writing (a weakness of mine) and an accountability mechanism as well as provide me with a thought catalog to reflect on throughout my life. 

That's what I'm hoping to get out of it. And if from time to time someone finds something interesting or helpful, all the better.

It is fair to expect posts relating to not only my career as a programmer (if all goes as planned), but also posts relating to my current interests of chess, weight lifting, reading, and bullet journaling. Who knows where this will all go, but I am sure future me will only regret having not started earlier.

If you've made it this far, thank you for staying with my rambling thoughts. Hopefully, by the time that you are reading this, there are plenty of posts for you to read next.
