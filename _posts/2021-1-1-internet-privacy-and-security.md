Don't be this guy when it comes to protecting yourself online.

Recently, I went through a bit of a internet-privacy-and-security kick. Looking back, there were a few things that contributed to my new interest. For starters, I spent a fair amount of time on the computer due to the [circumstances of the year](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html). More importantly, however, I watched the [Social Dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Social_Dilemma#:~:text=The%20Social%20Dilemma%20is%20a,Davis%20Coombe%2C%20and%20Vickie%20Curtis) on Netflix and had a serious self-reflection on both my lack of knowledge regarding this subject (a point of shame I felt as a computer science major) and the loss of self-control I was experiencing as a result of [surveillance capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_capitalism) and data mining. I concluded that I needed to take action to educate and protect myself. What I am writing now is the result of my research and what I've done about it. This is, of course, an incomplete guide to total protection and privacy with all things tech. I am simply sharing my findings in hopes of spreading awareness of this issue and providing some easy steps that anyone can do to help protect themselves.

Before I get into my findings, I want to first discuss why you should care about this issue.

In my opinion, there are really three issues at play here: privacy, security, and surveillance capitalism.

I think a common response to the case for internet privacy is to say, "Well, I'm not doing anything wrong. Why should I care?" And maybe the "If you've got nothing to hide, you've got nothing to fear" camp has a point, but I think Edward Snowden put it best when he said, "Arguing that you don't care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don't care about free speech because you have nothing to say." "When you say, 'I have nothing to hide,' you're saying, 'I don't care about this right.'"

In regards to security, the fact that [in 2018, 14.4 million Americans fell victim to identity fraud](https://www.iii.org/fact-statistic/facts-statistics-identity-theft-and-cybercrime) should be enough motivation to step up your online protection. Maybe you have insurance to protect you, but I guarantee you will save yourself a lot of time and aggravation in the long run if you take these small steps now.

If you are on the fence about whether surveillance capitalism is dangerous, watch the Social Dilemma. If you don't want to give up the 90 minutes, then I ask you to check your mobile device's screen time. If you feel good about that number, then I'm guessing you are in the minority. I believe that as "recommendation" technology advances, managing your screen time will only become more challenging. 

And if I haven't yet convinced you this is something to worry about, visit one of the few well-known data broker sites, such as [BeenVerified, Instant Checkmate, Intelius, MyLife, PeekYou, PeopleFinders, Pipl, PublicRecords, PublicRecords360, Spokeo, Whitepages, Zabasearch, and ZoomInfo](https://www.consumerreports.org/personal-information/how-to-delete-your-information-from-people-search-sites/#:~:text=If%20you're%20pressed%20for,Whitepages%2C%20Zabasearch%2C%20and%20ZoomInfo.). Put in your own name and see what information about you is publicly available. I think you might be surprised.

Despite all that, I want to reassure you that I truly believe it's possible to significantly improve your privacy and security on the Internet. Below, I've organized my findings by individual security and privacy topics to give you concrete action items to better protect yourself and your loved ones. So without further adieu...

**Passwordsnumbersandsymbols**

When it comes to "best practices" for online safety, proper password management should be a no brainer. Passwords are the first (and should be the strongest) line of defense between attackers and your data. While it might seem obvious that reusing the same password over and over is a vulnerability, unfortunately [in 2017, 39% of people reported using the same or similar passwords for multiple accounts](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2017/01/26/2-password-management-and-mobile-security/). In a way, I understand why. With seemingly every online service requiring users to make accounts, it can be overwhelming to manage all of those passwords. The best solution that I have found for this problem is to use a [password manager](https://www.howtogeek.com/141500/why-you-should-use-a-password-manager-and-how-to-get-started/), specifically one that is [Free and Open-Source Software](https://itsfoss.com/what-is-foss/). [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) and [KeePass](https://keepass.info/) (for the more tech-savvy) are my personal favorites. If storing all of your passwords in a single location behind one master key is concerning to you, first I want to assure you that I believe that [Bitwarden and Keepass are safe](https://www.passwordmanager.com/bitwarden-vs-keepass/). 

Additionally, I have two suggestions to further increase your password security. First, you can self-host your password manager so that your passwords are not stored outside of your control. Second, you can add a suffix to each of your passwords that you either remember and use across the board or record somewhere else. Let's say your suffix is "dog" (easy to remember). When creating a new password with your suffix (e.g. "3Mac&Cheese$dog"), you store just the password excluding the suffix, "3Mac&Cheese$", in your password manager and remember that your suffix is "dog". The real password to your account would be "3Mac&Cheese$dog". This way in the event someone does get access to your master key and all of your passwords, they still won't be able to access your accounts because they don't know your suffix.

Many services now are offering [Two-Factor Authentication](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/twofactor-authentication-2fa.asp), and I recommend employing it whenever you can, especially for important accounts like email, banking, social media, and your password manager.

Lastly, make your passwords strong. [Passwords are only getting easier to crack](https://www.betterbuys.com/estimating-password-cracking-times/), so use a combination of letters, numbers, and symbols for at least 12 characters.

**Do I Need That?**

Do I really need that flash games website account I made when I was 11 years old?

Does vans.com really need to know my date of birth?

Should Facebook be on and have access to my phone?

Delete unused accounts, remove unnecessary information, and uninstall those apps. By keeping your digital footprint as clean as possible, you set yourself up to be able to more easily manage what of your information lives on the internet. Not to mention, you will also create a smaller advertising ID.

In 2020, I set out to do exactly this. I attempted to find, properly manage, and set a unique password for every account I have ever created. I deleted any accounts I no longer needed. Truth be told, it was awful. The lengths that these services go to stop you from deleting your account is remarkable, and I think a strong signal of how more protective of my data I needed to be. All in all, I spent about 30 hours doing this and I am not even sure I got every account (not to mention the [ones you can't even delete](https://backgroundchecks.org/justdeleteme/)). While it was not something I enjoyed doing, I can say with certainty that I feel more confident about my digital footprint and my protection online after having done this.

If you are trying to find all the accounts you have ever made, filter emails by the keyword "Account". This trick saved me a lot of time.

**Stay up to Date**

In January of 2019, a bug in Apple's Facetime app allowed attackers to [self-answer Facetime calls](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-facetime-exploit-found-by-14-year-old-playing-fortnite/) without user interaction allowing for secret surveillance.

In May of 2019, Google announced a known venerability to their Titan Security Keys release in July of 2018 that allowed attackers [to take over users' devices and/or log into users' accounts](https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-to-replace-faulty-titan-security-keys/).

In October or 2019, Security Research Labs revealed that Alexa and Google Home devices could be [leveraged to phish and eavesdrop on users](https://www.zdnet.com/article/alexa-and-google-home-devices-leveraged-to-phish-and-eavesdrop-on-users-again/).

What is the one thing in common with all of these vulnerabilities? The proprietary software was patched in updates or replaced by the owners. Staying up to date with your software and devices keeps you the most protected against attackers. For this reason, I recommend keeping your devices scanning and set for automatic updates so that you get patches as soon as possible.

**Be Careful What You Share**

The minimalist in me is saying "less is more." We've all heard the mantra that the "internet is a permanent place." So, be careful what you put there. [More data](https://surfshark.com/blog/metadata) is included in what you upload than you might realize.

If you want to test how accessible your information is, visit one of the data broker sites listed above.

**Stop the Endless Scroll**

Of all the topics that I am addressing, this is the one that scares me the most. By endless scroll, I am referring to services that generate an endless supply of user ID curated content targeted at keeping the user active. This is the meat and potatoes of what the Social Dilemma and Professor [Shoshana Zuboff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIXhnWUmMvw) are concerned about.

What can you do about it? Delete or set time limits on apps that do targeted marketing, turn off notifications, and keep your phone out of sight, especially around bedtime. You can also consider contacting your government representatives to advocate for appropriate regulations.

**Browse Incognito**

Imagine everything you've ever typed into the search bar being recorded. Now think about what could be gleaned about you by reading those searches. Probably more than you are comfortable with. Do you want your health insurance provider to know you were searching for cancer warning signs? Would you want your boss to know that you were actively browsing for a new job? What if you lived under an oppressive government that had access to all this information? Seemingly innocent information can be more dangerous than we think. 

This gets into some territory that I feel is far too complex for my level of expertise, so let me refer you to [PrivacyTools](https://www.privacytools.io/browsers/#browser). Here you can find recommendations and explanations regarding search engines, VPNs, browsers, browser configurations, and more.

If you are interested in testing the privacy of your current setup, you can check your ISP and DNS security [here](https://ipleak.net/) and your browser fingerprint [here](https://coveryourtracks.eff.org/).

**Clean your Computer**

Now that you've cleaned up your online footprint, you need to clean your local identity. To delete unused software and files, as well as history, cookies, and cache on your devices, I recommend using a cleaning software such as [CCleaner](https://www.ccleaner.com/ccleaner). These softwares save a lot of time and better locate [unwanted apps and files](https://defeatpcvirus.com/2020/07/how-to-get-rid-of-potential-unwanted-app-found-virus/).

**Encrypt, Encrypt, @J#Noq2**

[Encrypting](https://heimdalsecurity.com/blog/free-encryption-software-tools/) your disks and private files puts another barrier between your data and attackers, especially if your device is stolen.

For Mac and Windows users, I recommend using the built-in encryption software, [FileVault](https://macpaw.com/how-to/use-filevault-disk-encryption) and [BitLocker](https://www.windowscentral.com/how-use-bitlocker-encryption-windows-10). I understand that they use proprietary encryption which likely includes a backdoor for these companies and/or the government, but any encryption is better than none.

For other encryption options, more information can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NfvKci3WF0).

**Mobile Settings**

[Today, smartphones are a fact of life](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/fact-sheet/mobile/). As our phones become more intelligent, they also become better [trackers](https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/2020/09/08/iphone-tracking-everywhere-you-go-how-find-setting/5695132002/).

I recommend following these configurations for [Android](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMWEym0KPcA) and [iOS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2bJVKcIEg0) to increase your protection.

**Final Thoughts**

If you would like to do further research on this subject, I strongly recommend checking out [Techlore on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs6KfncB4OV6Vug4o_bzijg), specifically the Go Incognito course. Henry and his team consistently put out excellent, practical, and uncomplicated content relating to privacy and security. Much of what I've learned about this subject comes from Techlore.

I hope you find this helpful and if you have not yet done so, that you implement at least a few of these suggestions. While the US Constitution may not contain an explicit right to privacy, it doesn't mean it isn't worth protecting. Lastly, I hope that by outlining all my efforts to contain my own privacy, no one takes this as a challenge.
